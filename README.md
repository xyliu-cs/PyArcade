# PyArcade
`PyArcade` is a repository that presents a collection of Python applications crafted throughout my undergraduate study. Owing to Python's high-level attributes, this repository focuses more on intriguing game design and efficient problem-solving tactics. For projects that delve into "lower levels" and align closely with software engineering, please refer to my **`FundamentalCS`** repository [here](https://github.com/xyliu-cs/FundamentalCS).

The repository will be consistently maintained and updated. The prefix (characters preceding the first hyphen) for the projects denotes the associated course and CS topic. So far, it has:
* **ML**: Machine Learning
* **RL**: Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence.

Each root-level folder signifies a standalone project. To run and test the projects, please first refer to the description file inside the project folder (e.g. `Design.pdf`, `problem_statement.pdf`), which will facilitate a better understanding of the program logic.

### Academic Integrity
Peer students who recognize some of the projects are welcome to peruse the codes and provide feedback. However, for academic endeavors, project design and coding should be carried out independently.
